directory containing codes for DAR and SAR computing
Corresponds to the paper 'Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic data reveals distinct patterns for developmental and housekeeping genes'

using dominance index for each window across three lineages
input counts of GC genome-wide
output differentially accessible windows (DARs) and similarly accessible windows (SARs) genome-wide

Requires MatlabR2014b
