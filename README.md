# joint_multiomic_analysis
 Consists of several modules of the analysis:
 - compute CG and GC counts in a 100 bp window
 
 - compute DARs, SARs
 To compute DARs and SARs one should have Matlab version at least Matlab2014. The main code to run is '    '. The input is specified by variables with the names of count files and their locations. The output soecified also by path/name of files to write computed DARs and SARs.
 
 - compute DMRs, SMRs
 - compute DEG and SEGs
 - link chromatin and genes
 - link DNA methylation and genes
 - define lineage specific pioneering and cooperative TFs
